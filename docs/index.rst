Welcome to the “Rudiments” manual!
==================================

*Rudiments* is a Python library that offers ‘miscellaneous’ functionality which
is unspecific in nature and shared among many projects. It also collects small
extensions to other support packages that don't warrant their own project,
in the :mod:`rudiments.reamed` package.
