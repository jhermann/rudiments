> *New release of my Python package with fundamental elements for any Python project, like configuration handling.*

[rudiments](https://github.com/jhermann/rudiments#readme) is a Python package that collects ‘miscellaneous’ functionality that is unspecific in nature and shared among many projects. The package provides runtime support for my [Springerle](https://github.com/Springerle) cookiecutters, which enable you to quickly create new Python projects that work out of the box.

The new [release 0.4.0](https://github.com/jhermann/rudiments/releases/tag/v0.4.0) fixes some minor problems regarding newer `Click` versions, and path handling under Windows. It also drops Python 2.7 support, so Python 3.5 or higher is required now.

See the [rudiments documentation](https://rudiments.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html) for details on using the contained features.
